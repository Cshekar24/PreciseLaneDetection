# PreciseLaneDetection
A project which was undertaken for mathematical foundation course during 1sem of Mtech DSML. Here we discussed A Precise Lane Detection Algorithm Based on Top View Image Transformation and Least-Square Approaches. This procedure has a particular use case in Self-driving/Autonomous cars.
